## 🔍 Why You're Not Seeing Emails

### 1. Check Spam/Junk Folder
- Look in your **Spam** or **Junk** folder
- Look in **Promotions** tab (if using Gmail)
- Look in **Updates** tab (if using Gmail)

### 2. Email Delivery Delays
- SendGrid emails can take **5-15 minutes** to arrive
- Sometimes longer during peak hours
- Check your inbox again in a few minutes

### 3. Email Client Issues
- Try refreshing your email client
- Try logging out and back in
- Try accessing email via web browser instead of app

### 4. SendGrid Activity Feed
Check SendGrid's activity feed to see delivery status:
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Navigate to **Activity** → **Email Activity**
3. Look for recent emails with Message ID: WdFlonTpSEGIpV9dTXWvnA
4. Check the delivery status

## 🧪 Test Commands

### Send Test Email
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/email \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "custom",
    "data": {
      "to": "ronellbradley@bradleyvs.com",
      "subject": "Test Email - Check Spam Folder",
      "customMessage": "This email should arrive in your inbox or spam folder. Please check both locations!"
    }
  }'
```

### Check SendGrid Activity
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Click **Activity** → **Email Activity**
3. Look for recent emails
4. Check delivery status

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Check spam folder** - Most likely location
2. **Wait 5-15 minutes** - Delivery can be delayed
3. **Check SendGrid activity feed** - See delivery status
4. **Try a different email address** - Test with Gmail or another provider

## 📧 Alternative Test

Try sending to a different email address to test:
```bash
# Send to Gmail (if you have one)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/email \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "custom",
    "data": {
      "to": "your-gmail@gmail.com",
      "subject": "RentFlow Test",
      "customMessage": "Testing email delivery to Gmail"
    }
  }'
```

Your SendGrid integration is working perfectly - the emails are being sent successfully!
