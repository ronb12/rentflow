# Settings Page - Payment Methods Fix

## Issue
The Edit Payment Methods functionality on the Settings page (`/dashboard/settings`) was not working properly. The buttons existed but had no functionality attached.

## Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Added Payment Method State Management** (`app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`)
   - Added `paymentMethods` state with sample data
   - Implemented `handleAddPaymentMethod` to add new payment methods
   - Implemented `handleEditPaymentMethod` to update existing payment methods
   - Implemented `handleDeletePaymentMethod` to remove payment methods with confirmation
   - Implemented `handleSetDefault` to set default payment method

2. **Integrated Modal Components**
   - Imported `EditPaymentMethodModal` from `@/components/edit-payment-method-modal`
   - Imported `AddPaymentMethodModal` from `@/components/add-payment-method-modal`
   - Added Trash2 icon import for delete buttons

3. **Updated Payment Methods UI**
   - Replaced static payment method cards with dynamic rendering from state
   - Added "Set Default" button for non-default methods
   - Integrated `EditPaymentMethodModal` component for each payment method
   - Added delete button with trash icon
   - Added empty state display when no payment methods exist
   - Integrated `AddPaymentMethodModal` component

4. **Enhanced AddPaymentMethodModal** (`components/add-payment-method-modal.tsx`)
   - Added `handleAdd` function to create new payment methods
   - Added CreditCard icon import
   - Improved button styling and layout
   - Added proper form actions (Cancel and Add)

### Features Now Working

✅ **Edit Payment Methods** - Click "Edit" to open full edit modal with all payment details
✅ **Delete Payment Methods** - Click trash icon to delete with confirmation
✅ **Set Default** - Click "Set Default" to make a payment method the default
✅ **Add New Payment Method** - Click "Add New Payment Method" button to add new methods

✅ **Visual Indicators** - Default badge shown on default payment methods

### Files Modified

- `components/add-payment-method-modal.tsx` - Add payment method modal component
