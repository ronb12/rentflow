Firebase is now linked to project: amplifi-a54d9

NEXT STEPS:

1. Enable services in Firebase Console:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/amplifi-a54d9

   Enable these services:
   - Authentication (Email/Password provider)
   - Firestore Database (test mode is fine for now)
   - Storage (test mode is fine for now)
   - Hosting (already configured)
   - Functions (for late fees & webhooks)

2. Get your Firebase config:
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ Your apps
   - Copy the config values
   - Add to .env.local file

3. Initialize Firebase services (run this command):
   firebase init firestore hosting functions

4. Deploy Firestore rules and indexes:
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes

5. Build and deploy the app:
   npm run build
   firebase deploy --only hosting

Note: Using an existing Firebase project is SAFE. Each project can host multiple apps.
This project (amplifi-a54d9) is now configured for RentFlow and Amplifi separately.
