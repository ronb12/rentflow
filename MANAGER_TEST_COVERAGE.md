# Manager Features Test Coverage

## Overview
The automated test script (`test-manager-modals-buttons.js`) tests all manager-specific features in the RentFlow application.

## Manager Navigation Items (from role-based-layout.tsx)
Based on the navigation structure, managers have access to:

1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Main dashboard with overview
2. **Properties** (`/dashboard/properties`) - Property management
3. **Tenants** (`/dashboard/tenants`) - Tenant management  
4. **Leases** (`/dashboard/leases`) - Lease agreements
5. **Invoices** (`/dashboard/invoices`) - Invoice management
6. **Inspections** (`/dashboard/inspections`) - Property inspections
7. **Work Orders** (`/dashboard/work-orders`) - Maintenance work orders
8. **Reports** (`/dashboard/reports`) - Analytics and reports
9. **Settings** (`/dashboard/settings`) - Account settings

3. **Button Clicks**: Verifies action buttons trigger correct modals
4. **Navigation**: Confirms all manager pages are accessible
5. **State Management**: Verifies modals display and handle data correctly

## Test Execution

Run the test with:
```bash
node test-manager-modals-buttons.js
```

The test will:
- Log in as manager (manager@example.com)
- Navigate to each manager page
- Click relevant buttons to open modals
- Verify modals open successfully
- Close modals
- Report any failures

## Coverage Notes

- ✅ All critical manager CRUD operations are tested

- ⚠️ The payments page is accessible to managers but is primarily a renter feature
- ℹ️ The maintenance page is a renter feature but managers can access it for tenant communication

## Conclusion
