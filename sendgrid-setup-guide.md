# SendGrid Sender Verification Required

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue
Your SendGrid API key is working, but your email address `ronellbradley@gmail.com` needs to be verified as a sender identity.

## âœ… Solution Steps

### 1. Verify Your Email Address
1. Go to [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Sender Authentication**
3. Click **Verify a Single Sender**
4. Enter your email: `ronellbradley@gmail.com`
5. Fill in the required information:
   - From Name: `RentFlow`
   - Reply To: `ronellbradley@gmail.com`
   - Company Address: Your business address
6. Click **Create**
7. Check your email for verification link and click it

### 2. Alternative: Use SendGrid's Test Email
For immediate testing, you can use SendGrid's built-in test email feature:
1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Mail Settings** â†’ **Sandbox Mode**
2. Enable Sandbox Mode (emails won't actually be sent, but API calls will work)

### 3. Test After Verification
Once verified, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/email \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "custom",
    "data": {
      "to": "ronellbradley@gmail.com",
      "subject": "RentFlow Test",
      "customMessage": "SendGrid is now working!"
    }
  }'
```

## ðŸ”§ Quick Fix for Development
If you want to test immediately without verification, you can temporarily use SendGrid's sandbox mode or use a different verified sender email.

## ðŸ“§ Production Setup
For production, you'll need to:
1. Verify your domain (not just email)
2. Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
3. Use a professional email like `noreply@yourdomain.com`

Your SendGrid integration is correctly set up - it just needs sender verification!
