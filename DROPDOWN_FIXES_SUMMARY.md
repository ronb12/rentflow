# Dropdown Visibility Fixes - Complete App Coverage

## Issue
Dropdown menus (Select components) throughout the app were not clearly visible due to missing explicit background and text colors.

## Solution
Added explicit styling to all SelectContent and SelectItem components to ensure proper visibility in both light and dark modes.

## Files Fixed

### 1. ✅ Add Payment Method Modal (`components/add-payment-method-modal.tsx`)
- Payment Method Type dropdown (Credit/Debit Card, Bank Account)
- Account Type dropdown (Checking, Savings)

### 2. ✅ Add Lease Modal (`components/modals/add-lease-modal.tsx`)
- Status dropdown (Active, Pending, Expired)

### 3. ✅ Add Property Modal (`components/modals/add-property-modal.tsx`)
- Property Type dropdown (Apartment, House, Condo, Townhouse, Commercial)

### 4. ✅ Document Upload Modal (`components/modals/document-upload-modal.tsx`)
- Document Type dropdown (Lease, Contract, Invoice, Receipt, Notice, Other)
- Category dropdown (Legal, Financial, Maintenance, Communication, Other)

### 5. ✅ Document Create Modal (`components/modals/document-create-modal.tsx`)
- Template Selection dropdown (all document templates)

### 6. ✅ Documents Page (`app/dashboard/documents/page.tsx`)
- Filter by Type dropdown (All Types, Lease, Contract, Invoice, Receipt, Notice, Other)
- Filter by Status dropdown (All Status, Draft, Pending Signature, Signed, Archived)

## Styling Applied

All Select components now use:
- **SelectContent**: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`
- **SelectItem**: `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`

This ensures:
- White background in light mode
- Dark gray background in dark mode
- High contrast text for readability
- Consistent styling across all dropdowns

## Total Dropdowns Fixed

**11 dropdowns** across **6 files**
