# Deployment Status

## Attempted Vercel Deployment

### Issues Found During Build
1. ✅ Fixed: `document.fileName` undefined in documents API route
2. ✅ Fixed: `doc.setFont(undefined, ...)` type errors in PDF generation
3. ✅ Fixed: `document.createElement` naming conflict with Document interface
4. ✅ Fixed: Empty `types/index.ts` file
5. ✅ Fixed: Empty `lib/image-compression.ts` file
6. ⚠️ Remaining: Type errors in inspections page (Date vs string)

### Next Steps

**Option 1: Fix Remaining Type Errors** (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/RentFlow
# Edit app/dashboard/inspections/new/page.tsx
# Change: date: new Date(formData.date)
# To: date: formData.date (if it's already a string)
```

**Option 2: Deploy Without Inspections Page**
Temporarily comment out the inspections import or make it optional.

**Option 3: Use Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Import RentFlow repository
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and deploy
4. Fix any build errors in the dashboard interface

## Current Status
- Build fails due to TypeScript type errors
- All other fixes applied successfully
- Invoice action buttons ready with improved feedback
