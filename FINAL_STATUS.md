```

```bash
cd /Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/RentFlow

# Check current status
git status

# See what commits are local
git log --oneline -5

# Force push (if you're sure about overwriting remote)
git push origin main --force

# Or merge with remote first
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Create New Repository
If git continues having issues:
```bash
cd /Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/RentFlow
rm -rf .git
git init
