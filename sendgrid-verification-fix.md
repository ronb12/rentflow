# SendGrid Sender Verification Fix

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue
Sender verification failed in SendGrid dashboard.

## ðŸ”§ Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Re-send Verification Email
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Sender Authentication**
3. Find `ronellbradley@gmail.com` in the list
4. Click **"Resend Verification"**
5. Check your Gmail inbox (including spam folder)
6. Click the verification link

### Solution 2: Delete and Re-add Sender
1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Sender Authentication**
2. Delete the existing `ronellbradley@gmail.com` entry
3. Click **"Verify a Single Sender"** again
4. Add your email with these exact details:
   - Email: `ronellbradley@gmail.com`
   - From Name: `RentFlow`
   - Reply To: `ronellbradley@gmail.com`
   - Company Address: Use your actual business address
   - City, State, Zip: Your actual location
5. Check Gmail for verification email

### Solution 3: Use Domain Authentication (Recommended)
Instead of single sender, authenticate your entire domain:
1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **"Authenticate Your Domain"**
3. Enter domain: `bradleyvs.com`
4. Follow DNS setup instructions
5. This allows any email from your domain to send

### Solution 4: Use a Different Email Provider
Try using an email that's easier to verify:
1. Use `ronellbradley@bradleyvs.com` as sender
2. Or use a different Gmail account
3. Or use a business email that's already verified

### Solution 5: Contact SendGrid Support
1. Go to https://support.sendgrid.com/
2. Submit a ticket about sender verification issues
3. Provide your API key and email address
4. Ask for manual verification assistance

## ðŸ§ª Test Commands

### Current Status (Sandbox Mode)
```bash
# Check current configuration
curl -s http://localhost:3004/api/email

# Test email (sandbox mode - won't be delivered)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/email \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type": "custom", "data": {"to": "ronellbradley@bradleyvs.com", "subject": "Sandbox Test", "customMessage": "This works in sandbox mode"}}'
```

### After Verification (Production Mode)
```bash
# Enable production mode
echo "NODE_ENV=production" >> .env.local

# Restart server
pkill -f "next dev" && npm run dev

# Test real email delivery
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/email \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type": "custom", "data": {"to": "ronellbradley@bradleyvs.com", "subject": "Real Email Test", "customMessage": "This should be delivered"}}'
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Alternative: Use Your Business Email as Sender

Let's try using your business email as the sender instead:

1. Update `.env.local`:
   ```
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=ronellbradley@bradleyvs.com
   ```

2. Verify `ronellbradley@bradleyvs.com` in SendGrid
3. This might be easier to verify than Gmail

## ðŸ“ž Immediate Action Items

1. **Try Solution 2** (delete and re-add sender)
2. **Check spam folder** in Gmail
3. **Try domain authentication** for `bradleyvs.com`
4. **Contact SendGrid support** if all else fails

Your email system is 100% ready - we just need to resolve the sender verification!
