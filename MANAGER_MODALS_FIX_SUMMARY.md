# Manager Modals Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Work Orders Page Modals
**Problem:** Work Orders page was using inline modals (custom div-based modals) instead of proper Dialog components.

**Solution:** Created three new modal components and converted all inline modals to use the Dialog component system:

1. **WorkOrderEditModal** - For editing work orders
2. **WorkOrderAssignModal** - For assigning technicians to work orders  
3. **WorkOrderScheduleModal** - For scheduling due dates

### Changes Made

#### New Files Created
- `components/modals/work-order-edit-modal.tsx`
- `components/modals/work-order-assign-modal.tsx`
- `components/modals/work-order-schedule-modal.tsx`

#### Files Modified
- `app/dashboard/work-orders/page.tsx`
  - Added imports for new modal components
  - Replaced inline modals with proper Dialog components
  - Updated handler functions to work with new modal interfaces

### Benefits

1. **Consistent UI/UX** - All modals now use the same Dialog component with proper styling and animations
2. **Better Accessibility** - Radix UI Dialog components include proper ARIA attributes
3. **Easier Maintenance** - Modal logic is separated into reusable components
4. **Proper Centering** - Modals appear centered with backdrop overlay
5. **Better Animations** - Smooth open/close animations included

### All Manager Modals Status

### Testing Recommendations

All manager modals should now:
1. Open as centered dialogs
2. Have proper backdrop overlays
3. Include smooth animations
4. Be accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
5. Close properly with ESC key or click outside

Test these pages to verify:
- `/dashboard/work-orders` - All three modals (Edit, Assign, Schedule)
- `/dashboard/tenants` - Add Tenant modal
- `/dashboard/properties` - Add Property modal
- `/dashboard/leases` - Add Lease modal
- `/dashboard/invoices` - View and Edit invoice modals
