# Modal Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Dialog Component
**Problem:** The Dialog component was a placeholder that didn't actually render modals properly.

**Solution:** Implemented a proper Dialog component using Radix UI primitives with:
- Proper overlay and animations
- Portal rendering
- Accessibility features
- All necessary Dialog sub-components (DialogTrigger, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogDescription, DialogFooter)

### 2. ✅ Invoice Edit Modal
**Problem:** The Edit Invoice button opened a modal that wasn't rendering properly due to the placeholder Dialog component.

**Solution:** 
- Updated the Dialog component with proper implementation
- Added `DialogFooter` import and usage to the InvoiceEditModal
- The modal now opens properly as a centered dialog instead of at the bottom of the page

### 3. ✅ Add Lease Modal
**Problem:** Add Lease modal was completely missing/empty.

**Solution:** Created a full-featured Add Lease Modal with:
- Property ID and Tenant ID fields
- Monthly rent amount
- Start and end dates
- Status selection (Active, Pending, Expired)
- Form validation
- API integration to create leases
- Success/error handling

### 4. ✅ Add Property Modal  
**Problem:** Add Property modal was completely missing/empty.

**Solution:** Created a full-featured Add Property Modal with:
- Property name and address
- Property type selection (Apartment, House, Condo, Townhouse, Commercial)
- Bedrooms, bathrooms, and square feet
- Monthly rent
- Form validation
- API integration to create properties
- Success/error handling

### 5. ✅ Edit Payment Methods
**Status:** Already working properly.

The Edit Payment Method modal in the payments page was already fully functional with:
- Complete form for editing credit cards
- Complete form for editing bank accounts
- Validation and formatting
- Secure update functionality

### 6. ✅ Add Tenant Modal
**Status:** Was already working properly.

No changes needed - the Add Tenant modal was already fully functional.
