## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Automatic Vercel Deployment
Since code was committed locally, you can:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" for the RentFlow project
3. Or push to GitHub to trigger automatic deployment

### Option 2: Manual Push to GitHub
```bash
cd /Users/ronellbradley/Desktop/RentFlow
git stash  # Save any uncommitted changes
git pull origin main  # Get latest remote changes
git stash pop  # Reapply your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix invoice action buttons"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Force Push (If needed)
⚠️ Only use if you're sure about overwriting remote:
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

## Testing After Deployment

1. Log in as manager
2. Go to Invoices page
3. Test each action button:
   - Click "View" - Should open modal with details
   - Click "Edit" - Should open edit form
   - Click "Download" - Should show progress and download PDF
